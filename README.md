## **Datasets**

### The analysis uses two datasets:

> **_game_sales_** - Contains game name, platform, publisher, developer, total units sold, and release year for the top 400 games by sales.
> **_reviews_** - Contains game name, Metacritic critic, and user scores for the top 400 games.


## **Analysis**

### The Jupyter Notebook walks through the key analysis steps:
+ Joining the game sales and reviewing datasets
+ Calculating average critic and user scores by year
+ Identifying peak years based on the highest average scores
+ Comparing critic vs user top-scored years
+ Finding peak sales years and comparing them to top-scored years
  

## **Insights**

+ The years with the **highest average critic** and **user scores**
+ The** difference between critic** and **user-preferred years**
+ **Peak sales years** and **how they align with top-rated years**
  

## **Contents**
The repository contains:

+ Jupyter Notebook with data preparation, analysis, and visualizations
+ CSV files of the cleaned datasets

The notebook has full details on the analysis process and results.
